  <p>
    Welcome. Pleasant Ridge Covenant Church is a small, faithful congregation
    committed to daily worship, vigilance, and stewardship of the land
    entrusted to us.

  <h2>About the Archive</h2>

<p>
This site serves as a digital record of Pleasant Ridge Covenant Church,
preserving selected sermons, attendance entries, and historical notes
from across generations. Not all gatherings were documented fully, and
not all records were intended to endure.
</p>

<p>
Materials are presented as they were received and retained according to
their usefulness at the time. Absence of detail should not be taken as
absence of practice.
</p>

  <p>Morning Worship is held daily at <strong>9:00 AM</strong>.</p>
