  <h2>Founded (1847)</h2>
  <p>
    Pleasant Ridge Covenant Church was organized in 1847 as a small rural congregation.
    For generations it has served families across Hearthwell Township through worship,
    mutual aid, and stewardship of the land.
  </p>

  <h2>Milestones</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>1847:</strong> Congregation organized.</li>
    <li><strong>Late 1800s:</strong> Meetinghouse expanded as attendance grew.</li>
    <li><strong>1930s:</strong> Relief efforts and shared meals during hard seasons.</li>
    <li><strong>Post-war era:</strong> Restoration work and renewed community outreach.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Early 1940s</h2>

<p>
The early 1940s marked a period of irregular recordkeeping for the congregation.
Wartime conditions, fuel rationing, and shifting attendance led to services being
held at varying hours and, at times, without full documentation. Several gatherings
from this period are known to have occurred without complete written or numerical
records.
</p>

  <h2>Record Keeping</h2>
  <p>
    The church maintains simple records of gatherings and attendance. Selected entries
    are shared in the Attendance Ledger for archival purposes.
