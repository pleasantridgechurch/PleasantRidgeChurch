  <p><strong>Text:</strong> Colossians 3:23–24, Psalm 90:17</p>
  <p><strong>Delivered:</strong> Autumn 1934</p>

  <h2>Sermon</h2>

  <p>Beloved, there are seasons when the work is ordinary and the results feel small. Yet Scripture teaches us
  that faithfulness is not measured by applause, but by endurance.</p>

  <p>“Whatever you do, work heartily,” the apostle writes—not because the work itself saves us,
  but because our hearts are formed by what we practice. A steady hand becomes a steady spirit.</p>

  <p>Some duties are quiet: repairing what is worn, tending what is living, returning again to what must be done.
  These are not lesser callings. They are the scaffolding of a faithful life.</p>

  <p>So we ask the Lord to establish the work of our hands. Not to make every effort easy,
  but to make it meaningful—so that even the smallest act of care becomes part of His good order.</p>

  <p>Do not despise the humble task. The Lord often hides His mercy inside routine.</p>

  <h2>Closing Prayer</h2>
  <p>Lord, establish the work of our hands. Give us patience in small labors, courage in hard days,
  and a spirit willing to serve. Amen.</p>
