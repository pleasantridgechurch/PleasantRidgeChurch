  <p><strong>Text:</strong> Luke 15:3–7, Ezekiel 34</p>
  <p><strong>Delivered:</strong> Spring 1978</p>

  <h2>Sermon</h2>

  <p>Beloved, the Shepherd knows His flock not by number, but by absence.</p>

  <p>We are taught to count what is present. God teaches us to count what is missing.
  The ninety-nine do not trouble Him, for they are known by their staying.
  It is the one who does not answer when called that receives His full attention.</p>

  <p>But hear this carefully: the Shepherd counts twice.</p>

  <p>He counts once when the gate is closed.
  He counts again when it is opened.
  And if the numbers differ, He does not ask which sheep wandered—
  He asks what the pasture failed to keep.</p>

  <p>Some absences are loud. Some are polite.
  Some leave footprints. Some leave only a space where a voice once was.</p>

  <p>We are not afraid of the wolf nearly as much as we should be afraid of forgetting.</p>

  <p>So we keep our records.
  We say the names aloud.
  We notice when a place remains empty too long.</p>

  <p>Because the Shepherd will ask us what we did when we realized someone was missing.</p>

  <h2>Closing Prayer</h2>
  <p>Shepherd of the lost and the lingering, teach us to notice rightly.
  Keep us from careless counting, and lead us to the ones who have not yet come home. Amen.</p>
