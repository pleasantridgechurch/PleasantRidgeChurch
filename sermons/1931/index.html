  <p><strong>Text:</strong> Matthew 7:13–14, Psalm 24</p>
  <p><strong>Delivered:</strong> Winter 1931</p>

  <h2>Sermon</h2>

  <p>Beloved, there is a difference between an open door and a welcoming door.</p>

  <p>Some think holiness is a thing that shines. I tell you holiness is a thing that keeps.
  It keeps the faithful. It keeps the stranger safe. It keeps the boundary where it belongs.</p>

  <p>We speak often of hospitality, and rightly. But Scripture does not command us to be careless.
  The narrow gate is narrow for a reason, and the way that leads to life is not the way that
  every wandering voice will recognize.</p>

  <p>So we keep the door in three ways:</p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>By name.</strong> We do not receive what refuses to be named.</li>
    <li><strong>By witness.</strong> We do not receive what cannot bear being seen in the light.</li>
    <li><strong>By time.</strong> We do not receive what demands to enter in haste.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>If it is good, it can wait. If it is true, it can be spoken plainly. If it is from God,
  it will not fear the lamp.</p>

  <p>And if a thing grows angry when you ask it to identify itself—then you have learned what it is.</p>

  <h2>Closing Prayer</h2>
  <p>Lord of the threshold, give us courage to be kind and wisdom to be careful.
  Teach our hands what to open and our hearts what to refuse. Amen.</p>
