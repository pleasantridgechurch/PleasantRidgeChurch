  <p><strong>Text:</strong> Mark 13:33–37</p>
  <p><strong>Delivered:</strong> Late Winter 1942</p>

  <h2>Sermon</h2>

  <p>Beloved, the command to watch is not given only to those who expect danger.
  It is given to those who expect delay.</p>

  <p>The household that sleeps without concern may be caught unaware,
  not because the master arrives suddenly,
  but because the servants have forgotten that waiting itself is a duty.</p>

  <p>To remain watchful is not to live in fear.
  It is to live with attention.</p>

  <p>Some signs are loud and demand response.
  Others are quiet and require patience.
  The danger is not missing the sign,
  but convincing ourselves that nothing is being asked of us.</p>

  <p>We are told to keep watch at every hour,
  for the hour that seems least important
  is often the one in which responsibility is tested.</p>

  <p>So we do not wait passively.
  We wait faithfully.</p>

  <h2>Closing Prayer</h2>

  <p>Lord of the watch and the waiting,
  keep us attentive in ordinary hours.
  Teach us to serve as though the moment matters,
  because it does. Amen.</p>
