  <p><strong>Text:</strong> Luke 16:10, Micah 6:8</p>
  <p><strong>Delivered:</strong> Spring 1935</p>

  <h2>Sermon</h2>

  <p>Beloved, much of the Christian life is lived beyond notice. The Lord does not require us
  to be remarkable, but to be faithful.</p>

  <p>Scripture tells us that one who is faithful in little is faithful also in much.
  This faithfulness is not loud. It does not demand recognition.
  It is practiced in choices that seem small at the time they are made.</p>

  <p>To walk humbly with God is to accept that obedience often looks ordinary:
  showing up, speaking truth gently, doing what is right even when it passes unseen.</p>

  <p>The world trains us to measure worth by result. The Lord measures by faith.
  What is done quietly in devotion is never wasted.</p>

  <p>So let us not grow weary in the unseen good.
  The God who sees in secret remains attentive.</p>

  <h2>Closing Prayer</h2>
  <p>God of steady mercy, teach us to be faithful in small things.
  Strengthen us to walk humbly, act justly, and love mercy all our days. Amen.</p>
