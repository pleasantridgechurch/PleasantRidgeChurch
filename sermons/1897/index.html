  <p><strong>Text:</strong> John 10 (selected), Psalm 121</p>
  <p><strong>Delivered:</strong> Autumn 1897</p>

  <h2>Sermon</h2>

  <p>Beloved, the Lord does not merely watch the road—He watches the gate.</p>

  <p>Some gates keep wolves out. Some keep sheep in. And some, by long use and long prayer,
  learn the weight of a hand and the sound of a footfall. A gate may be wood and iron to strangers,
  but to the household it becomes a kind of memory.</p>

  <p>We are told the Shepherd calls His own by name. I tell you plainly: not every voice that says your name is holy.
  The Adversary also learns names. The world learns names. The field learns names.
  And there are places that keep them.</p>

  <p>So we practice a simple obedience: when you return, you return rightly. You do not climb.
  You do not enter by the old hinge. You do not knock where you were not invited.</p>

  <p>Enter by the gate.</p>

  <p>And if the gate does not open—do not force it. Stand. Breathe. Pray.
  Consider what in you is unfamiliar.</p>

  <p>Some will laugh and call this superstition. But we are not a laughing people.
  We are a keeping people.</p>

  <h2>Closing Prayer</h2>
  <p>Lord of the threshold, Shepherd of the living, keep our steps known and our hearts clean.
  Teach us the way that opens, and shut the way that should not be walked. Amen.</p>
