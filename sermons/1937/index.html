  <p><strong>Text:</strong> Ecclesiastes 3:1, Lamentations 3:22–23</p>
  <p><strong>Delivered:</strong> Spring 1937</p>

  <h2>Sermon</h2>

  <p>Beloved, there is a season for every matter under heaven, and there are times
  when the most faithful act is simply to return to ordinary days.</p>

  <p>After periods of uncertainty, we are often tempted to search for meaning in
  what has passed. Yet Scripture reminds us that mercy is renewed each morning,
  not stored from yesterday.</p>

  <p>The work of faith is not to preserve every experience, but to meet the present
  day with attention and gratitude.</p>

  <p>We give thanks for calm seasons not because they explain what came before,
  but because they allow us to live rightly now.</p>

  <p>So we return to our routines, our work, our worship, trusting that today’s
  faithfulness is sufficient.</p>

  <h2>Closing Prayer</h2>

  <p>God of new mercies, meet us again this morning.
  Teach us to receive what is given today,
  and to walk faithfully in ordinary time. Amen.</p>
