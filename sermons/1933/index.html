  <p><strong>Text:</strong> Matthew 6:9–13, Exodus 16 (selected)</p>
  <p><strong>Delivered:</strong> Summer 1933</p>

  <h2>Sermon</h2>

  <p>Beloved, we pray for daily bread because God intends us to live one day at a time.</p>

  <p>In anxious seasons we reach forward, trying to store certainty like grain. But the Lord taught
  His people in the wilderness that provision is not the same as hoarding. What He gives today is
  enough for today, and what He gives tomorrow will be enough for tomorrow.</p>

  <p>Daily bread is not only food. It is strength to work, patience to endure, and kindness to share.
  It is the grace to do what is right when no one is watching, and the humility to ask for help when
  our hands are empty.</p>

  <p>So we practice gratitude in small measures: a meal, a neighbor, a quiet moment of peace.
  These are not minor gifts. They are the Lord’s careful care, repeated.</p>

  <p>And we remember: the prayer is not “give me bread forever,” but “give us bread today.”
  Faith grows by returning again tomorrow.</p>

  <h2>Closing Prayer</h2>

  <p>Father, give us what we need for this day. Teach us to trust You tomorrow,
  and make us generous with what You provide. Amen.</p>
