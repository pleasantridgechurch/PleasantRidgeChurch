  <p><strong>Text:</strong> James 1:2–4, Psalm 66</p>
  <p><strong>Delivered:</strong> Spring 1932</p>

  <h2>Sermon</h2>

  <p>Beloved, Scripture does not promise us easy seasons. It promises us that no season is wasted.</p>

  <p>Many among us are weary. The fields have not yielded as they once did. Work has grown scarce.
  Plans we once trusted have not held. Yet the Word tells us that endurance, when it has finished its work,
  produces a faith that does not crumble under weight.</p>

  <p>Faith is not proven in abundance. It is proven in continuance.</p>

  <p>When the days are lean, we do not abandon prayer—we simplify it.
  When certainty is absent, we return to the practices that have always sustained us:
  gathering, reading, singing, and serving one another.</p>

  <p>God is not absent in hardship. He is present in the forming.</p>

  <p>So we do not ask when the season will change.
  We ask what kind of people this season is shaping us to be.</p>

  <h2>Closing Prayer</h2>

  <p>Lord of every season, strengthen us to endure what we cannot yet understand.
  Shape our faith to be steady, and teach us to trust You in all circumstances. Amen.</p>
