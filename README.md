# Pleasant Ridge Covenant Church

This repository contains a fictional archival website documenting the history,
sermons, and records of Pleasant Ridge Covenant Church.

The materials are presented as they were preserved. Some records are incomplete.
No attempt has been made to reconcile gaps or inconsistencies beyond what the
archive itself allows.

There is no interactive component beyond reading.

Visitors are encouraged to approach the site as they would any institutional
record: attentively, but without expectation of resolution.
